#Amazon Web Services: Solutions 101

You can create Ribbon SBC configurations quickly, reliably, and without being an expert in cloud or Ribbon SBC by using the AWS CloudFormation templates (CFTs) on https://github.com/F5Networks.
Each CFT creates a pre-configured Ribbon SBC solution, saving you the time and effort involved in a manual configuration.
CFTs can create configurations like:
- A standalong SBC VE instance
- Two SBC VE instances with failover/high availability
- An SBC High Availability "triple" with two SBC instance and a HighAvailability Front End (HFE) 

Additionally, each CFT can:
- Introduce an SBC into an existing environment (useful when you already have apps in the cloud and want to add BIG-IPs)
