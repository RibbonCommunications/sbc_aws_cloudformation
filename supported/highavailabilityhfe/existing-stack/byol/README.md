**HFE Options**

For each template, you have different options for licensing your Ribbon SBC. Note that not all options are available for all templates.

  - **HFEautoSubnet**   
    The private subnet created between the HFE and SBC VEs is automatically created by the template.

  - **HFEmanualSubnet**   
   Creation of the private subnet between the HFE and SBC VEs is to be created manually prior to running the template.
