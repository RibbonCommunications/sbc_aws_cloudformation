**HFE Options**

For each template, you have different options for licensing your Ribbon SBC. Note that not all options are available for all templates.

  - [**HFEautoSubnet**](https://github.com/RibbonCommunications/sbc_aws_cloudformation/blob/master/supported/highavailabilityhfe/existing-stack/byol/HFEautoSubnet.md)   
    The private subnet created between the HFE and SBC VEs is automatically created by the template.

  - [**HFEmanualSubnet**](https://github.com/RibbonCommunications/sbc_aws_cloudformation/blob/master/supported/highavailabilityhfe/existing-stack/byol/HFEmanualSubnet.md)   
   Creation of the private subnet between the HFE and SBC VEs is to be created manually prior to running the template.
