**Licensing Options**

For each template, you have different options for licensing your Ribbon SBC. Note that not all options are available for all templates.

  - [**BYOL**](https://github.com/RibbonCommunications/sbc_aws_cloudformation/tree/master/supported/highavailabilityhfe/existing-stack/byol)
  
    Bring your own license (BYOL) templates require you have a valid SBC license to be able to activate SBC features. Contact your Ribbon Sales representative to acquire BYOL licenses.

  - **PAYG**Â   
  
    Pay as you go (PAYG) templates allow you to use hourly licensing. At the present time Ribbon does not support pay as you go option for the SBC.
