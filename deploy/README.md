# DEPLOY

Although these Cloudformation templates are meant to serve more as a reference, you can indeed deploy them directly.  

The templates prefixed with **"existing-stack"** are generally more indicative of how we expect customers to deploy Ribbon SBCs (insertion into an existing environment).

>  **NOTE** 
>  The user is expected to be familiar with AWS prior to attempting to deploy the Ribbon SBC in AWS.
>  See [Ribbon SBC AWS SBC Instantiate Pre-Requisites](https://github.com/RibbonCommunications/sbc_aws_cloudformation/blob/master/supported/pre_requisites/README.md#ribbon-sbc-aws-sbc-instantiate-pre-requisites) for more details about SBC pre-requisites such as AWS VPC, networking objects and security group.
